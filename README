JavaFastPFOR: A simple integer compression library in Java
Daniel Lemire, http://lemire.me/en/

== What does this do  ==

It is a library to compress and uncompress arrays of integers 
very fast. The assumption is that most (but not all) values in
your array use less than 32 bits.

These sort of arrays often come up when using delta coding.

== Why? ==

I found a few libraries that implemented Binary Packing, NewPFD, OptPFD,
Variable Byte, Simple 9 and so on in Java. However, I could not find
one that I liked.

I threw in a cool little benchmark program.

== License ==

This is code is released under the
Apache License Version 2.0 http://www.apache.org/licenses/.

== Requirements ==

A recent Java compiler.

== What can I do? ==

Compile the code and execute integercompression.benchmark.

I recommend running all the benchmarks with the "-server" flag.

Speed is always reported in millions of integers per second.

== Limitation ==

Currently this library compresses and uncompresses arrays in bulk.
An alternative strategy is to compress them block-by-block.

== Installing java 7 (optional) ==

Good instructions:
